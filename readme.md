# Registration Form

## Synopsis

This project is a simple web-based registration form. When a user fills out the form and submits it, the form data is validated and a confirmation dialog is shown to the user. If the user confirms the information, a thank you message is displayed and the form fields are cleared. If the user cancels, the form fields are also cleared.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the registration form.
- `registration.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the form submission and validation logic.
- `WebSiteDevRegForm.code-workspace`: The Visual Studio Code workspace configuration file.
